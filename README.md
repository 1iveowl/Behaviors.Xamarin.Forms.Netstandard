## Credits
This project is based on [Behaviors for Xamarin.Forms](https://github.com/davidbritch/behaviors) by David Britch. Without his work, this library would not be. All this library really is, is an update for .NET Standard 1.3 and .NET Standard 2.0. 

For documentation see [Behaviors for Xamarin.Forms](https://github.com/davidbritch/behaviors)
